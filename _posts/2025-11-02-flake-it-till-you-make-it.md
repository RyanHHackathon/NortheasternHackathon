The Ludlow Institute is an educational and research non-profit organization dedicated to advancing human freedom through technology, focusing heavily on digital privacy and individual autonomy. Founded by privacy advocate Naomi Brockwell, the Institute's core mission is to equip individuals with the knowledge and tools to protect their fundamental rights in the modern, surveillance-prone digital age. They achieve this primarily through educational media published under the platform NBTV, which creates accessible videos, tutorials, and articles explaining privacy risks and practical solutions. In addition to educational outreach, the Ludlow Institute supports research into surveillance practices and the development of privacy-enhancing technology to ensure human dignity extends to the digital landscape across the globe.
